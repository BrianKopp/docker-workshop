# Multi-Stage Typescript Express

This example shows a backend Express app written in Typescript.

It includes:

* prettier and eslint for formatting & linting
* docker-compose for building and running
* nodemon for hot-reloading
* jest for testing
* winston for logging
* tsyringe for a dependency-injection

It is largely based on the typescript starter found
[here](https://github.com/bitjson/typescript-starter).
